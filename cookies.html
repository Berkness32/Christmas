    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2&half; cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>&half; teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1&half; teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1&half; cups semisweet chocolate chips (see tip)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven
            to 350&deg;F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl
            with a handheld electric mixer), beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until 
            light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs and beat until blended. Add the vanilla
            and beat until blended. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the mixer off and add the flour mixture to the bowl. Mix on
            medium just until the flour is mixed in, then turn the mixer to high speed for a few 
            seconds to pull the dough together; it will be chunky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chocolate chips and beat on high for about 5 seconds to 
            thoroughly and quickly mix in the chips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop by large spoonfuls on the lined baking sheet; don't 
            flatten them. Bake until lightly browned on top, 10 - 11 minutes. 
            Cool on the pan on a rack for 1 minute, then transfer the cookies
            to the rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining cookie 
            dough.
