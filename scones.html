    <h1>Maple Scones</h1>
    <h3>scones</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface</li>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (¾ stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure maple extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pure maple extract</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375&#176;F. Line a 
            baking sheet with parchment paper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder 
            and salt. Add the butter cubes and toss to coat. Using a 
            pastry blender or your fingers, cut in the butter until
            it resembles coarse crumbs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, cream maple extract, 
            and vanilla extract. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture
            and mix until a dough is formed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly flour a work surface. Pat the dough into a round about 
            8 inches in diameter and ½ inch thick and cut it into 8 wedges,
            as you would a pizza. Carefully place each scone on the baking 
            sheet, keeping about 2 inches between the scones. Refrigerate,
            uncovered, for 15 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer to the oven and bake until the bottoms of the scones are 
            lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let the scones cool for 5 to 10 minutes, 
            then transfer them to a rack to finish cooling, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, to make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the 
            powdered sugar, cream, and maple extract until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle the glaze on the cooled scones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days
        </li>
    </ol>
